	<p>During the 2022-2023 school year I faced difficulties with my Honors Chemistry class but I also had fun in my elective classes like Financial Literacy. Honors Chemistry was the most difficult class I took this year but it was all worth it in the end because I learned lots of new material and got to work with my classmates. I also took Spanish 2, APCSP, Health, IM3, English 3-4, and Modern World History. I really enjoyed taking APCSP this year as it helped me build off of my Joy of COmputing Class I took my freshman year.</p>
